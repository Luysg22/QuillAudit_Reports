## Smart Contracts, Blockchain , DApps Audit Reports

Our comprehensive analysis framework employs both **Manual** and **Automated** methodologies to deliver a holistic solution for the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and logic violations within smart contract code. This multifaceted approach meticulously evaluates critical dimensions of smart contract integrity:

**Security Assessment**: We conduct rigorous evaluations to ascertain the security robustness of the code, probing for vulnerabilities that may expose it to malicious attacks or unauthorized access.

**Documentation Alignment**: Our analysis extends beyond code examination to validate its alignment with associated documentation, including whitepapers. This ensures that the implemented code accurately reflects the intended design.

**Gas Optimization**: We meticulously scrutinize the code to ensure optimal gas consumption, adhering to best practices for efficiency. This includes optimizing computational processes and minimizing resource consumption.

**Code Quality**: We prioritize code readability and adherence to established best practices, enhancing maintainability and reducing the likelihood of errors or inefficiencies.

Through this comprehensive approach, we empower you to deploy smart contracts with a high degree of confidence in their security, accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to industry standards.

# Summary

**QuillAudits** is a secure smart contract audits platform designed by **QuillHash Technologies**. It is a fully automated platform to verify smart contracts to check for security vulnerabilities through it's superior manual review and automated tools. We conduct both smart contract audits and penetration tests to find potential security vulnerabilities which might harm the platform's integrity.

## Why is Security Audit Necessary?

Not all smart contracts are as **“smart”** as we think they are. Security is a critical issue in the case of smart contracts. Recent hacks of smart contracts escalated the matter. An audit from trustful third party is the most ingenuous way to identify bugs, vulnerabilities and security flaws in smart contracts which might have remained unnoticed at production level and if your smart contract is ready to deploy this will be the last chance to save your project from becoming another victim of crypto hacks because of irreversible nature of smart contracts.

## Some common bugs in smart contracts that got funds worth millions of dollars stolen :

**Insecure coding practices**: Many smart contract vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices, such as not properly validating inputs or not handling exceptions correctly

**Poor system design**: Flaws in the overall system design can lead to vulnerabilities in smart contracts. For example, a lack of proper access controls or a complex interaction between different components can create opportunities for attackers

**Incorrect implementation**: Mistakes in implementing the intended logic of a smart contract can result in vulnerabilities. This can include errors in the code itself or in the way the contract interacts with other components of the system

**Lack of proper security controls**: Smart contracts should have robust security controls in place to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. Without these controls, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities and steal funds

**Reentrancy attacks**: A reentrancy attack is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can repeatedly call a contract's function before the previous call has finished, allowing them to drain the contract's funds. This was the case in the Parity MultiSig Wallet hack, where $31 million worth of Ether was stolen

**Unchecked external calls**: Smart contracts that make external calls without properly validating the results can be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the contract's state and steal funds

**Misconfigured functions**: In some cases, smart contracts have functions that are misconfigured, allowing attackers to exploit them and steal funds. For example, the SQUID token scam involved a misconfigured smart contract function that allowed hackers to steal $3.38 million from investors
